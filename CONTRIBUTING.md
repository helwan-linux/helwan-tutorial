## 🚀 What Is Helwan Linux?

Helwan Linux is not just a distro — it's a development ecosystem.

It comes with:

- Developer-first setup (Docker, VTE, GTK, Qt, VSCodium, Rust, etc.)
- Original tools:
  - `hel-terminal` – our own terminal emulator
  - `hel-store` – lightweight GUI app store
  - `hel-ai-gate` – local AI interface
  - `hel-welcome-app`, `hel-markdown`, `hel-usb-writer`, and more.
